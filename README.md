# GO HEXAGONAL ARCHITECTURE EXAMPLE

> DISCLAIMER: Code in this repository is intended for educational purpose. This project is using a modular monolithic architecture employing the hexagonal architecture pattern, type-driven development and a production-ready approach just as a learning process for various concepts and best practices in software development. Also note the the goal of this project is to be able to use the ports and adpater nature to integrate with many technologies and services as possible.

This repository aims to showcase advanced techniques for building `close` to  production-ready application in Golang. Mostly inspired by the [realworld-go](https://github.com/AngusGMorrison/realworld-go) by `AngusGMorrison`. The project is primarily a learning exercise for various Golang and DevOPS concepts.

## Hexagonal Architecture

This project is just an implementation of the `Hexagonal Architecture` but for an explanation of this architecture and its benefits, you can check out [realworld-go](https://github.com/AngusGMorrison/realworld-go), where he references some interest articles on the topic from `Netflix` and `Uber`. For a video explanation on the architecture checkout [How To Structure Your Go App - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFog2kZsHk&list=PL7g1jYj15RUPjxpD_PDt8L7IlA-VpT0t8) playlist.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by and borrows concepts from [Realworld-go](https://github.com/angusgmorrison/realworld-go) by Angus Morrison. The original code provided valuable insights into structuring a Go application using hexagonal architecture.
